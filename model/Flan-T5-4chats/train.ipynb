Maybe we could camp for just a night or two.\n","There are campgrounds a few hours away. I could take more time off, but it depends on when. I work at a small company and you can't take time off that overlaps with someone else.\n","I know of a place nearer that has a small pond with a hiking trail. Maybe we could plan ahead for it.\n","Yes, planning ahead would work. I mostly just can't time off on short notice. I'm not super busy at work like you always are, but there's enough work that they'd struggle if two people were out the same days.\n","That'll work out fine because my schedule is usually very flexible.
